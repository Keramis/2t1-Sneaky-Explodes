# 2t1-Sneaky-Explodes
This is a script for 2take1.
The features are constantly updating, and if you want a feature added, please open an issue, and ask for a feature. I will do my best to implement said feature.

Features of said script:

- Set the explosion visible or invisible.

- Explode all NPCs with no blame

- Explode all in lobby with no blame

- Check for godmode in the lobby (soon to be updated)

- Kill a person with no blame + Includes water hyrant

- Kill a person with no blame, Looped + Includes water hydrant

- Make a person commit suicide

- Make a person commit suicide, Looped

- Make a person explode the whole lobby + Includes water hydrant

- Make a person explode the whole lobby, Looped + Includes water hydrant

- Make a person explode all NPCs

- Make a person explode all NPCs, Looped

- Make a person explode people who are inside of vehicles (like insurance fraud)

- Make a person explode people who are inside of vehicles, Looped

- Make a person explode another player

- Make a person another player, Looped

- The two above check for interior and godmode.

- Check if a person is in godmode

- Check a person's health

- Set a person's health to 0. Why would you do this?

- Check the lobby for modders
- - Godmode lobby check
- - Modded health lobby check


TAKE NOTE! THIS WILL BE UPDATED A LOT.
Also, this is half- a proof of concept. Don't take this _too_ seriously.
